I don't trust anything in writing unless a lawyer says it's enforceable in both directions. I came on as a systems administrator, and I've been doing sysadmin + helpdesk. There's "other duties as assigned" and "a second full-time job." $5k in guaranteed salary, even if there's OT and a bonus on top of that, isn't much of a jump. I could theoretically be commanding $90k with a VCP. The commute's longer with no traffic, and "no traffic" is rare on 287 in the mornings. I'd rather be doing a city commute for the same work if I can get it. There's plusses, don't get me wrong. I'm not out to shit on the position, just that I'm going to fight for more compensation or guaranteed perks if they come to me with an offer, and get as much as I can out of it within reason before I start thinking seriously about it.
